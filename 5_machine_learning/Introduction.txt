** Best viewed in IDE or VS Code

From here this will start getting complicated
Please make sure you have read and understood basics, data science

Previously we have learned to analyze and visualize data but apart from statistical data
we didn't really extract any knowledge and we were certainly not able to predict future data

This is where machine learning comes to play

In this series we will dive deep into machine learning and python language
We will train and apply complex machine learning models and at the end
you will be able to develop and optimize your own AI suited for your specific tasks

You need to know these things before understanding these concepts:
* basics and intermediate of python
* Basic understanding of data science
*libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Q. What is Machine Learning?
==> Machine Learning is the science in which we focus on teaching machines or computers to perform
certain tasks without being given specific instructions
We want it to learn how to do the task without explaining it to them

Notice, machine learning and artificial intelligence are not same.
artificial intelligence(AI) is a broad field and every system that can learn and solve problems might be considered AI

Machine learning is one specific approach to this broad field. In Machine learning the AI does not receive any instructions.
It isn't static and doesn't follow clear and strict steps to solve the problemd.
It's dynamic and restructures itself.

LOADING DATA

To get started with our code we first need the data that we want to work with.
Here we use a data set from UCI.

Now we can start coding
